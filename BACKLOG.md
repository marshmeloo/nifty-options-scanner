# Backlog — before going live with real capital

Things that are working and acceptable during the evaluation/testing
phase, but worth revisiting before real money is on the line.

## Forward-validate SCORING_MODE = "momentum_only" before trusting its size (added 2026-08-02)

Adopted live 2026-08-02 as the default scoring mode -- see config.py's
`SCORING_MODE` docstring and README's 2026-08-02 entry for the full
evidence trail (493-day, 2-year forward-return study; momentum ROC
alignment the only component that survived Bonferroni correction across
41 tested; re-weighted variants backtested with the daily-loss and
exposure gates actually enforced).

This is an IN-SAMPLE result. The variant was designed by studying the
same 493 days it was then tested on, the underlying data has no bid/ask
(LTP fills, so every figure is an optimistic ceiling), and it trades
~5x/day versus the legacy scorer's ~1x/day, which compounds the LTP-fill
optimism roughly proportionally. No untouched data remains to check it
against. Forward (live) results are the only real test left -- until a
meaningful number of live sessions confirm it, treat the backtested
total (+Rs 470,031 / 493 days at Rs 5L capital) as a ceiling, not an
expectation, and watch the daily-loss breaker: the backtest breached it
on 11 of 493 days.

Switching back to `SCORING_MODE = "legacy"` is a one-line, fully-tested,
reversible change (see tests/test_scoring_mode.py) if live results
diverge materially from the backtest.

## Fast position-check: lightweight LTP endpoint (added 2026-07-27)

`main_live.py`'s `check_open_trades_fast()` (runs every
`config.FAST_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, 5s by default, to catch a
target/stop spike between full 30s scan cycles) currently re-fetches the
**full option chain** each time — simple, reuses fully-tested code, but
heavier than it needs to be at a fast cadence.

Dhan has a lighter endpoint built for exactly this: `POST
/v2/marketfeed/ltp`, which returns just the LTP for a specific list of
security IDs (see `dhanhq.co/docs/v2/market-quote/`). Switching to it
requires:
1. Downloading and parsing Dhan's instrument master file (maps every
   contract to its security ID) — a new data source we don't currently use.
2. Resolving each open trade's (strike, expiry, option_type) to its
   security ID via that master file.
3. Using those IDs in the `/marketfeed/ltp` call instead of the full
   `/optionchain` fetch.

Worth doing before relying on fast polling with real capital, both for
efficiency and to reduce load against Dhan's rate limits.

## Broker-side protective stop-loss

Discussed at length (see README's "silent freeze" incident notes): even
with `supervisor.py` auto-restarting on crash/freeze, there's a gap
between "the process dies" and "the supervisor notices" where an open
position has zero protection. The only way to close that gap completely
is a stop-loss order sitting on the exchange itself (a Dhan GTT order
placed at trade entry) — a deliberate, not-yet-made decision to start
placing real orders, since everything currently here is analytics/
tracking only.

## Order flow

Needs Dhan's WebSocket Live Market Feed (separate paid Data API
subscription, ₹499+tax/month) and a genuinely different process
architecture — not a REST-polling module like everything else here.
Scoped out for now; revisit once the above two items are settled.

## Dhan rate limiting across three concurrent processes (observed live, 2026-07-30)

Real log from a live `main_condor.py` session:

```
[10:57:14] (dhan) NIFTY spot 24350.7
  [data source] dhan failed, falling back: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://api.dhan.co/v2/optionchain
  [data source] nse failed, falling back: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.nseindia.com/api/option-chain-indices?symbol=NIFTY
  Error this cycle (will retry next cycle): 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.nseindia.com/api/option-chain-indices?symbol=NIFTY
```

UPDATE: the original version of this entry conflated two separate
failures. The second one -- MTM reading "unavailable" even on cycles
where the chain fetch clearly succeeded -- turned out to be a real bug
in our own code (`STRIKE_RANGE_POINTS` silently dropping an
already-tracked strike as spot drifted), **fixed** -- see the README's
"Fixed: 2026-07-30" entry. What's left in this backlog item is only the
genuine external-service problem: both tiers occasionally failing
together with no snapshot at all for that cycle. Same root causes,
still diagnosed, not yet built:

**1. Dhan 429 (rate limit). FIXED 2026-07-31.** Confirmed the problem
reached beyond `main_condor.py`: on 2026-07-31 the same rate-limit
storm hit `main_live.py` directly while a real trade was open -- 48 of
72 failure-related log lines that day landed during that one position,
including the 5s fast-check itself failing outright ("Both dhan and
nse sources are in cooldown"). Nothing broke only because that trade
never approached its stop/target during the gaps -- luck, not the
system working as designed. A stop/target check silently not running
during a real approach is a risk to the P&L data this project's whole
measurement effort depends on.

  Built both fix directions:
  - `dhan_rate_limiter.py`: a file-lock-based cross-process request
    spacer. Before every Dhan HTTP call, each of the three processes
    now calls `wait_for_slot()`, which checks a shared state file for
    the wall-clock time of the last Dhan request **by any process**
    and sleeps out the remainder of `MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (3.5s) if
    needed. Uses `os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL` for an atomic, portable
    advisory lock; force-clears locks older than `STALE_LOCK_SECONDS`
    (10s) so a crashed owner can't deadlock the other two processes;
    gives up and proceeds without the lock past
    `MAX_ACQUIRE_WAIT_SECONDS` (8s) rather than ever blocking a trading
    loop indefinitely over a coordination mechanism. Wired into all 4
    of `dhan_source.py`'s `requests.post()` call sites. Covered by
    `tests/test_dhan_rate_limiter.py` (spacing enforcement, stale-lock
    clearing, fail-open behavior under contention).
  - `config_directional_spread.py`'s `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` widened
    30 -> 90: this strategy's entry signal is a bias score that doesn't
    move within seconds like the momentum scanner's setups do, so
    there's no accuracy cost, and it cuts this process's share of
    shared Dhan request volume to a third of what it was.

  What this does NOT fix: NSE fallback tier blocking (#2 below) --
  unrelated, external, and not being pursued (see that item).

**2. NSE 404 (fallback tier blocked).** Tested the exact endpoint
directly: the cookie warm-up GET to the NSE homepage itself now returns
403 with zero cookies set, before the API call is even reached. The
"404" body served on the API call is a bot-challenge page, not a
genuine NSE 404. NSE's anti-bot detection has tightened beyond what the
current `requests`-based approach (User-Agent + cookie warm-up) can
satisfy -- likely TLS/JA3 fingerprinting or similar, which `requests`
can't replicate. `nse_source.py`'s own docstring already flagged this
endpoint as unofficial and liable to start blocking without notice.

  Not attempting a code fix that tries harder to look like a browser --
  that starts crossing into bot-detection evasion, which is out of
  scope regardless of urgency. If this tier needs to be reliable, the
  real fix is a licensed/paid data feed, not a better disguise for an
  unofficial endpoint. Until then: when BOTH tiers fail together on an
  open position, that's a real blind spot worth a human glancing at the
  log for, especially over an unattended overnight hold.

## Parameter tuning (lower priority, not safety-critical)

Several thresholds across the codebase are explicitly documented inline
as "starting assumptions, not researched optima" — `config.py`'s
`SMART_MONEY_NEUTRAL_BAND`, `NEWS_RISK_ELEVATED_THRESHOLD`,
`VOLUME_PROFILE_BIN_POINTS`, and `config_condor.py`'s
`HEDGE_DISTANCE_POINTS` among them. Worth revisiting once enough real
sessions have accumulated to tune them against actual data rather than
guesses — see each config comment for the specific reasoning already
documented there.
